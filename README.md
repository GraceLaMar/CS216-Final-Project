# Basketball Stats Visualization

## Project Overview

This Python GUI project reads basketball player stats from a CSV file, visualizes the total points using a pie chart, and saves a summary of the data to a new CSV file. 
## Files

### **basketball_gui.py**
- **Description**: Main Python program with a graphical user interface that:
  - Reads player names and point totals from `basketball_points.csv`
  - Displays the data as a pie chart using the `tkinter` Canvas
  - Writes a summary to `basketball_summary.csv`

### **basketball_points.csv**
- **Description**: Data generated from chatGPT containing player names and point totals.
- **Format**:
    ```csv
    Player,Points
    Jordan,23
    LeBron,30
    Kobe,28
    Curry,35
    Durant,31
    Bird,27
    Shaq,22
    Iverson,24
    Duncan,26
    Giannis,32
    ```

### **basketball_summary.csv**
- **Description**: Output file generated by the program containing the same data as the input, reformatted after processing.

## Program Features

### **Menu Options**
- **File > Open**: 
  - Reads player data from `basketball_points.csv`
  - Displays a pie chart showing each player's contribution to total points
  - Writes a summary to `basketball_summary.csv`

- **File > New**: 
  - Clears the canvas to reset the graph

- **File > Exit**: 
  - Closes the program

### **Pie Chart Drawing**
- Each playerâ€™s total points are converted into a slice of the pie chart.
- Each slice is colored from a list of colors.
- The pie chart is drawn starting from the top (270 degrees clockwise).

### **Summary Output**
- The program creates a new file, `basketball_summary.csv`, listing each player and their total points.
